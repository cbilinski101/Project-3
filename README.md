# Energy Data Visualization Project

This repository contains three interactive data visualization projects related to global energy consumption trends. Each visualization provides insights into different aspects of energy usage globally.

## **1. Global Primary Energy Consumption by Source**

### Overview
This project visualizes global primary energy consumption from 1800 to 2023 using an interactive area chart. The data is sourced from the **Energy Institute** and **Smil (2017)** and follows the "substitution method" for energy conversion.

The visualization presents trends in primary energy sources such as renewables, nuclear, fossil fuels, and biomass.

### Directory Structure
```
üìÅ global-energy-substitution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-energy-substitution.csv          # Historical energy consumption data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-energy-substituition.py           # Python script for creating the area chart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-energy-substituition.html         # Exported interactive HTML area chart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-energy-substitution.metadata.json # Metadata file with details about the dataset
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ global-energy-substitution.png           # Static PNG of the visualization
```

### Chart Description
- **Title:** Global Primary Energy Consumption by Source (1800‚Äì2023)
- **Energy Sources:** Includes coal, oil, gas, renewables, nuclear, and traditional biomass.
- **Visualization Type:** Stacked area chart illustrating the growth of each energy source over time.

### How to Run
1. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas plotly
   ```
2. Update the script with the local file path for the CSV:
   ```python
   file_path_global = "./global-energy-substitution.csv"
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python global-energy-substituition.py
   ```
4. Open `global-energy-substituition.html` in your browser to view the interactive chart.

## **2. Per Capita Primary Energy Consumption by Source**

### Overview
This project visualizes per capita energy consumption for select countries in 2023 using a stacked bar chart. The data is sourced from the **Energy Institute - Statistical Review of World Energy (2024)** and various population datasets.

The visualization compares energy consumption per person for different countries, highlighting how the consumption of coal, oil, gas, renewables, nuclear, and other sources varies.

### Directory Structure
```
üìÅ per-capita-energy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ per-capita-energy-stacked.csv           # Dataset containing energy consumption per capita
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ per-capita-energy.py                    # Python script for creating the bar chart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ per-capita-energy.html                   # Exported interactive HTML bar chart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ per-capita-energy-stacked.metadata.json  # Metadata file detailing the dataset
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ per-capita-energy.png                    # Static PNG of the visualization
```

### Chart Description
- **Title:** Per Capita Primary Energy Consumption by Source (2023)
- **Energy Sources:** Coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, and other renewables.
- **Countries Covered:** United States, China, India, France, Germany, and others.
- **Visualization Type:** Stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of energy sources for each country.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas plotly
   ```
2. Update the script with the local file path for the CSV:
   ```python
   file_path = "./per-capita-energy-stacked.csv"
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python per-capita-energy.py
   ```
4. Open `per-capita-energy.html` to view the interactive bar chart.

## **3. Share of Electricity Production from Renewables**

### Overview
This choropleth map visualizes the share of electricity produced from renewable sources across the world in 2023 using a choropleth map. The data is sourced from **Ember** and the **Energy Institute - Statistical Review of World Energy (2024)**.

The visualization presents how much of each country's electricity is generated by renewables, including hydropower, solar, wind, biomass, waste, geothermal, wave, and tidal sources.

### Directory Structure
```
üìÅ share-electricity-renewables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ share-electricity-renewables.csv         # Dataset containing electricity production data by country
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ share-electricity-renewables.py          # Python script for creating the choropleth map
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ share-electricity-renewables.html        # Exported interactive HTML choropleth map
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ share-electricity-renewables.metadata.json # Metadata file with detailed descriptions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ share-electricity-renewables.png         # Static PNG of the map visualization
```

### Map Description
- **Title:** Share of Electricity Production from Renewables (2023)
- **Coverage:** Global, with data for individual countries.
- **Visualization Type:** Choropleth map showing the percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources.
